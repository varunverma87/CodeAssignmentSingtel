Animal should not implement both of the Swim and Fly interfaces.so, Animal should rather be a top-level, while the interfaces should be implemented by specific sub-classes of Animal.Basically, i have used the Bridge design pattern which prevents the explosion of number of subclasses for each possible combination of animals and behaviors.
I have completed upto Fish model and time out.

Explanation of remaining questions:

1) Butterfly model implementation is same as of fish.

2) Count can easily be made by using "instanceof" operator for each reference against the implementation classes defined in project.

3) Internationalization can be achieved by using locale and define messages in xml.

4) For restful API, converts the project to dynamic web project and expose the implementation classes.
